    <h1>Hi, I'm Miriam and I'm a Scanner!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my homepage. In her book "Refuse to Choose" the amazing Barbara Sher explains what Scanners are and talks about making
      a life-bookshelf for yourself. I am however a bit of a nomad and one of the projects I've been working on is learning to code so I 
      thought I'll combine my new interest and create a digital life-bookshelf. Welcome!
    </p>
    
    <h2>What's a Scanner?</h2>
    <p>
      Ever felt like there's something wrong with you because the mere thought of having one - yes ONE - career is so terrifying that you'd 
      rather be a bum all your life? Every been looked down upon because "You can't keep a job down" or are "flaky" or "lack focus" or 
      possibly the worst of all "afraid of success"? Well, chances are that you are what Barbara Sher calls a Scanner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scanner is a person who has lots of interests. Everyone has lots of interests, you might thing, but we scanners are a bit more 
      extreme. Boredom is our worst enemy and we have to follow our passions or life's just not worth living to us. In her book, Barbara (I feel 
      like she wouldn't mind me calling her that) explains in detail why we are like this and that there's nothing wrong with us. We're just wired 
      differently. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As art therapy but also part self-valuing, she suggests that people build shelves for all their projects. It took me a while to realise why I 
      didn't love the idea. I mean, of course I <span>loved</span> the idea, meaning I imagined all those beautiful shelves covered with beautiful
      boxes growing up <span>other people's</span> walls but I couldn't even imagine building such a shelf for myself. Took me two weeks to come up
      with a solution. Yes, you're looking at it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is my life-wall. It doesn't contain all of the projects I've started and worked on. Far from it. I'm too busy starting new ones to 
      catch up with the past thirty years. But it does contain my favourites. Look around, get inspired, maybe create your own life-website to inspire
      other people. And let me know how it goes :)
