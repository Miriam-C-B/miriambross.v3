    <h1>Resources</h1>

    <p>
      Here's a list of resources I found helpful in case you want to try some of the things I did. I've read/watched/taken/listened to all 
      the books/newsletters/courses/podcasts listed. If a link is an affiliate link, it's clearly marked (AL). 
    </p>
    <p class="last-line">
      If you've read my project pages I apologise for repeating myself but I really I cannot stress enough, that, yes, you can learn anything. 
      All you have to do is find the teacher <span>and</span> learning method that works best for you. What I'm saying is, 
      I found these resources helpful and I <span>think</span> they are a good starting point. But if they don't work for you, please don't get 
      discouraged. Keep on looking and try new teachers and methods. You've got this!  
    </p>

    <h2>Books I found mind-blowing</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li>This one, of course: <span>Refuse to Choose!</span> by Barbara Sher. I also loved <span>Live the Life you Love</span>. 
        If you prefer videos, Barbara's Ted talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2rG4Dg6xyI" target="_blank">"Isolation is the dream-killer, 
          not your attitude"</a> is amazing.</li>
      <li><span>Emotional Intelligence</span> by Daniel Goleman is one of the books I think everyone should read. Goleman 
          explains how powerful emotions are and why emotional intelligence is so important.</li>
      <li>Charles C. Mann's <span>1491</span> is brilliant. Mann shares the latest theories about the Americas before the European invasion and its harrowing 
        consequences. You should also read the book if you're an aspiring researcher in <span class="bold">any</span> field because he shows how personal and political 
        biases not just influence but even create scientific "facts".</li>
      <li><span>In Search of Schrödinger's Cat</span> by John Gribbin tells the story of Quantum Mechanics. This should be taught in schools!</li>
      <li><span>Fat Chance</span> by Dr. Robert Lustig explains why sugar is so much worse for our bodies than we think. I changed my diet after reading it.</li>
      <li>So I can't actually recommend <span>The Lucifer Effect</span> by Philip Zimbardo because it was unfortunately written in a very dry style. I skipped and 
        speed-read a lot. But the topic is important. The 1971 Stanford Prison experiment taught us how much we are influenced by the situations 
        and roles we are in. Absolutely worth googling!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Author business</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li><span>Turning Pro</span> by Steven Pressfield is a great kick in the pants if you want to turn your art into a profession.</li>
      <li>Check out Joanna Penn's website <a href="https://www.thecreativepenn.com/" target="_blank">The Creative Penn</a> and her 
        <a href="https://www.thecreativepenn.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcast</a>. Both are a well of information for Indie authors. 
        <span>Your Author Business Plan</span> is great if you want to shift into a business mindset. All of Joanna's non-fiction books for authors are brilliant!</li>
      <li>Jane Friedman's <a href="https://janefriedman.com" target="_blank">website</a> has posts for Indie and traditionally published authors. 
      Her free newsletter <span>Electric Speed</span> is well worth your time.</li>
      <li>I'm looking forward to Kristine Kathryn Rusch's <a href="https://kriswrites.com/" target="_blank">blog/newsletter</a> every week. She'll teach you 
      about the importance of copyright and yes, that is something you absolutely want to learn about.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Mindset</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li>I'm a big fan of Dana Wilde. She wrote the book <span>Train Your Brain</span>, has a <a href="https://danawilde.com/show/" target="_blank">podcast</a> I love, 
      and a free newsletter I read every day. Your best starting point, especially if you want to run your own business. </li>
      <li>Mel Robbins made a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n8i7ua0mSw" target="_blank">video</a> about reframing fear as excitement.</li>
      <li><span>Heal your Body</span> by Louise Hay is my constant companion. Whenever something's wrong in my body I use it to find out what's 
        really wrong in my life so I can fix it.</li>
      <li><span>The 10-Day Anxiety Detox Plan</span> by Lewis David works! The book also includes access to audio files and I'm still occasionally listening
      to the hypnotherapy recording. It's so relaxing. <span>Mindfulness for Stress and Anxiety</span> by Antonia Ryan (who read the hypnotherapy recording) was
      also helpful.</li>
      <li>Problems dealing with change? Read <span>Who Moved My Cheese?</span> by Spencer Johnson, or watch a fifteen-minutes long animation 
        on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOUeHPS8A8g&t=567s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. "Keep looking for cheese" is also the 
        perfect mantra for a Scanner.</li>
      <li>So, <span>The One Thing</span> by Gary Keller might seem wasted on a Scanner. However, it contains an exercise on page 144 that allows you 
          to connect future goals to present actions. It's by far the best cure for procrastination I have ever encountered and works <span class="bold">every single 
            time</span> for me. The exercise alone makes the entire book worthwhile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Financial Independence</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li><span>The Psychology of Money</span> by Morgan Housel is a fantastic place to start your FI journey. The book is entertaining and stuffed with 
        valuable insights.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure: Not at all a big fan of Robert T. Kiyosaki and do not recommend any other of his products and courses. However, I found
        <span>Rich Dad Poor Dad</span> and <span>Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant</span> (if you want to run your own business) very helpful. </li>
      <li>I like to listen to <a href="https://podcast.farnoosh.tv/" target="_blank">So Money</a> with Farnoosh Torabi.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li><span>Story</span> by Robert McKey. I keep going back to it.</li>
      <li>Same with <span>It was the best of sentences, it was the worst of sentences</span> by June Casagrande. I re-read it at least once a year.</li>
    </ul>
