    <h1>Getting a University Degree</h1>

    <p>
       I love learning so not going to university was never an option, even though I was the first in my family who got a university degree. At first, I wanted to 
       study biology. I was on the "science track" at school and loved biology classes, especially micro-biology and organic chemistry. Luckily, I took a suitability
       test first. I failed because I was not ok with experimenting on animals. I'm still not, so dodged a bullet there! 
    </p>
    <p>
      Next I thought about psychology. I took an extracurricular class at school, read a psychology magazine and even bought a text book. The latter turned out to be
      a very good idea. When I tried to read the text book I realised pretty immediately that psychology was not for me. I didn't want to learn about experiments 
      and their obvious results. I wanted to learn about people. How they behaved and why. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning I woke up and knew what I'd have to do. Books were about people and life. All I had to do was read. 
       I decided to study literature and since my favourite author was (and still is) Agatha Christie, English Literature it was. 
    </p>
    <p class="last-line">
      I moved to Munich, picked Comparative Literature and Sociology as my minor subjects, changed the latter a year later to French (with a focus on literature) and 
      never looked back.  
    </p>
