    <h1>Getting a University Degree</h1>

    <p>
       I love learning. I knew I wanted to study something pretty early on in school. I'm the first person in my family who got a university degree 
       so I didn't have any role models as such. Still, not studying was never really an option. I never had any doubts that I belonged at a university. 
       Which university and what subject was a different matter.
    </p>
    <p>
       My first idea was to study biology. In Germany pupils have to choose "tracks". At most schools this means you get to choose between a language or a science
       track. I picked science. We all had to do math, German and a foreign language (I picked French) for our A-levels and then two more main subjects, which 
       depended on the track you picked. Mine were chemistry and biology. I LOVED micro-biology and organic chemistry. But when I did a test provided by a university 
       to check if you're suitable to study biology, I failed it because I was not ok with experimenting on animals. Still am not.  
    </p>
    <p>
      So then I thought I'd study psychology. For the entire last year at school I came quite convinced that was the subject for me. I took an extracurricular class
      at school, read a psychology magazine and even bought a text-book. That turned out to be a really good idea! I realised within the first ten pages that this 
      was not for me. The book listed lots of experiments over the past and what people had found out. With every experiment I read about I kept thinking, "Well, duh! 
      Of course people behaved that way!" So psychology was out. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, I woke up one morning and the solution was right there. I loved literature. Books were about people and life. If I wanted to learn about people and life,
      all I had to do was read. I decided to study literature and since my favourite author was (and still is) Agatha Christie, English Literature it was. 
    </p>
    <p class="last-line">
      I moved to Munich, picked Comparative Literature and Sociology as my minor subjects, changed the latter a year later to French (with a focus on literature) and 
      never looked back.
