    <h1>Must-reads</h1>

    <p class="last-line">
      Here's a list of resources and interesting books you might find helpful in case you want to try some of the things I did. 
      I tend to learn best from reading, which is why the lists include more books than videos and podcasts. I've read/watched/taken all the resources 
      myself. If a link is an affiliate link, it's clearly marked. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've read all of my project pages sorry for the repetition but I cannot stress this enough: You can learn anything. All you have to do is find 
      the teacher/method of learning that works best for you. What I'm saying is, I found these resources helpful but that doesn't mean you will too. If you 
      don't go out there and find what's right for you! Just keep on trying :) 
    </p>

    <h2>Books I found mind-blowing in general</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li>This one, of course: <span>Refuse to Choose!</span> by Barbara Sher. I also loved <span>Live the Life you Love</span>. 
        If you prefer videos, Barbara's Ted talk "Isolation is the dream-killer, not your attitude" is amazing. 
        It's on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2rG4Dg6xyI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</li>
      <li><span>Fat Chance</span> by Dr. Robert Lustig explains why sugar is so much worse for our bodies than we think. I changed my diet after reading it.</li>
      <li>Charles C. Mann's <span>1491</span> is brilliant. Mann shares the latest theories about the Americas before the European invasion and its consequences. 
        You should also read the book if you're an aspiring researcher in ANY field because he shows how personal and political biases influence and 
        even create scientific "facts".</li>
      <li>So I can't actually recommend <span>The Lucifer Effect</span> by Philip Zimbardo because it was unfortunately written in a very dry style. I skip and speed 
      read quite a lot. But the topic is very important so you google the 1971 Stanford Prison experiment.</li>
      <li><span>In Search of Schrödinger's Cat</span> by John Gribbin tells the story of Quantum Mechanics. This should be taught in schools!</li>
      <li><span>Emotional Intelligence</span> by Daniel Goleman is one of the books I think everyone should read. Goleman 
        explains how powerful emotions are and why it's so important to practice emotional intelligence.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li><span>Story</span> by Robert McKey. I keep going back to it.</li>
      <li>Same with <span>It was the best of sentences, it was the worst of sentences</span> by June Casagrande. I re-read it at least once a year.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Author business</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li><span>Turning Pro</span> by Steven Pressfield is a great kick in the pants if you want to turn your art into a profession.</li>
      <li>I also found <span>Publishing 101</span> by Jane Friedman helpful. It's a collection of her blog posts so if you don't mind 
      reading in your browser you can get the same information (and updated too) on her <a href="janefriedman.com" target="_blank">website</a>.</li>
      <li>See Joanna Penn from <a href="https://www.thecreativepenn.com/" target="_blank">The Creative Penn</a> if you want to learn how to think of a single 
        book as several products. She also wrote <span>Your Author Business Plan</span> which I can highly recommend. It's a great way to shift your mindset. All of
        her non-fiction books for authors are brilliant!</li>
      <li>I'm looking forward to Kristine Kathryn Rusch's<a href="https://kriswrites.com/" target="_blank">blog/newsletter</a> every week. She'll teach you 
      about the importance of copyright.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Mindset</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li>I'm a big fan of Dana Wilde. She wrote the book <span>Train Your Brain</span>, has a <a href="https://danawilde.com/show/" target="_blank">podcast</a>
      and a free newsletter I read every day. Your best starting point, especially if you want to run your own business. </li>
      <li>Mel Robbins made a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n8i7ua0mSw" target="_blank">video</a> about reframing fear as excitement.</li>
      <li><span>Heal your Body</span> by Louise Hay is my constant companion. Whenever something's wrong in my body I use it to find out what's 
        really wrong in my life so I can fix it.</li>
      <li><span>The 10-Day Anxiety Detox Plan</span> by Lewis David works! The book also includes access to audio files and I'm still occasionally listening
      to the hypnotherapy recording. It's so relaxing. <span>Mindfulness for stress and Anxiety</span> by Antonia Ryan (who read the hypnotherapy recording) was
      also helpful.</li>
      <li>Problems dealing with change? There's the book <span>Who Moved My Cheese?</span> by Spencer Johnson. Or you could watch a fifteen-minutes long animation 
        about the topic on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOUeHPS8A8g&t=567s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Keep looking for cheese is also the 
        perfect mantra for a scanner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Financial Independence</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li><span>The Psychology of Money</span> by Morgan Housel is the best place to start your FI journey. The book is entertaining and the chapters
      are short and sweet.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure: Not at all a big fan of Robert T. Kiyosaki and do not recommend any other of his products and courses. I found
        <span>Rich Dad Poor Dad</span> and <span>Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant</span> (if you want to run your own business) helpful. </li>
      <li>I like to listen to <a href="https://podcast.farnoosh.tv/" target="_blank">So Money</a> with Farnoosh Torabi.</li>
      <li><span>Quit like a Millionaire</span> by Kristy Shen and Bryce Leung offers a "How to" guide to reach FIRE. It was written for North American readers
      so a lot of the steps they mention do no apply to the rest of the world, but might give you ideas on equivalents you might want to try in your country. If
      you're in your mid-thirties and don't work in a high-paying industry (like I did when I read the book) you might not want to start with this book because
      it can be demoralizing.</li>
    </ul>
