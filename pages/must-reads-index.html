    <h1>Must-reads</h1>

    <p class="last-line">
      On this page I collected a few resources you might find helpful in case you want to try some of the things I did. The page is called must-reads for simplicity
      and because I tend to learn best from books. But there are also links to YouTube videos here. I've read/watched/taken all of the books, videos or courses
      myself. None of the links are affiliate links. 
    </p>

    <h2>General</h2>
    <p class="last-line">
      These are books that don't fit into specific categories but enriched my life or blew my mind or were just too good not to share.
    </p>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li>This one, of course: <span>Refuse to Choose!</span> by Barbara Sher. I also loved <span>Live the Life you Love</span>, which is for everyone, not just 
      scanners. Then there's her Ted talk "Isolation is the dream-killer, not your attitude". It's on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2rG4Dg6xyI" target="_blank">
        YouTube</a>.</li>
      <li><span>Fat Chance</span> by Dr. Robert Lustig explains why sugar is so much worse for our bodies than we think. I changed my diet after reading it.</li>
      <li>Charles C. Mann's <span>1491</span> is brilliant. Mann shares the latest theories for what the Americas looked like before Europeans invaded the continents
      and the consequences of that invasion. It's an absolute must-read for an aspiring researcher in ANY field because he shows how personal
      and political biases influence, even create, scientific "facts".</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Author business</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li><span>Turning Pro</span> by Steven Pressfield is a great kick in the pants if you want to turn your art into a profession.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Mindset</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li>I'm a big fan of Dana Wilde. She wrote the book <span>Train Your Brain</span>, has a <a href="https://danawilde.com/show/" target="_blank">podcast</a>
      and a free newsletter I look forward to every day. Your best starting point, especially if you're considering starting your own business. </li>
      <li>Mel Robbins made a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n8i7ua0mSw" target="_blank">video</a> about reframing fear as excitement.</li>
      <li><span>Emotional Intelligence</span> by Daniel Goleman isn't really about mindset but one of the books I think everyone should read in their life. He 
      explains just how powerful emotions are and why it's so important to practice emotional intelligence.</li>
      <li><span>Heal your Body</span> by Louise Hay is my constant companion. Whenever something's wrong in my body I use it to find out what's 
        really wrong in my life so I can fix it.</li>
      <li><span>The 10-Day Anxiety Detox Plan</span> by Lewis David works! The book also includes access to audio files and I'm still occasionally listening
      to the hypnotherapy recording. It's so relaxing. <span>Mindfulness for stress and Anxiety</span> by Antonia Ryan (who read the hypnotherapy recording) was
      also helpful.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Financial Independence</h2>
    <ul class="mr-lists">
      <li><span>The Psychology of Money</span> by Morgan Housel is probably the best place to start your FI journey. The book is entertaining and the chapters
      are short and sweet.</li>
      <li>In <span>The Richest Man in Bablyon</span> George S. Clason teaches you about finance through stories. Great if you prefer learning that way.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure: Not at all a big fan of Robert T. Kiyosaki and do not recommend any other of his products and courses. Only <span>Rich Dad Poor Dad</span> and
      <span>Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant</span> (if you want to run your own business). </li>
      <li><span>Quit like a Millionaire</span> by Kristy Shen and Bryce Leung offers a "How to" guide to reach FIRE. It was written for North American readers
      so a lot of the steps they mention to no apply to the rest of the world, but might give you ideas on equivalents you might want to try in your country. If
      you're in your mid-thirties and don't work in a high-paying industry (like I did when I read the book) you might not want to start with this book because
      it can be a mit demoralizing.</li>
    </ul>
